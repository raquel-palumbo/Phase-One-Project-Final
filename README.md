## Project Overview
<ins>Purpose</ins>

This project aims to make three business reccommendations for a company looking to expand into the aviation industry. This company is looking to acquire airplanes for both commerical and private usage. This analysis aims to help the company decide on:

1. Which aircrafts to purchase
2. Which areas to fly in
3. What purposes of flight to get involved in 

<ins>The Data</ins>

The dataset used came from the National Transportation Safety Board. It cotains information on aviation accidents from 1962 - 2023 in the US and international waters. 
The dataset initally contained 88,889 aviation accidents.


## Conclusions
This analysis leaves us with three reccommendations for moving into airplane purchasing and operation:

1. ***Purchase/operate Boeing 777s.*** Boeing 767 and 737s, as well as Airbus A320 are also good model options, with over 90% of passengers uninjured.

2. ***Operate in the Northeast.*** The Midwest and Southeast are the next best options, all having a percentage of uninjured passengers above 85%.

![Best Regions](Images/Passenger-Outcomes-(%)-v-Region.png)

3. ***Mainly operate flights for Executive/Corporate Purposes.*** Public Use - Federal and PUBS had the highest percentage of uninjured passengers, but due to barriers to entry, most likely impractical. Executive/corporate flights had the next highest percentage of uninjured passengers at 73% and seems more practical for a comapany to enter into.

## Next Steps
The data analyzed here only included data on aircraft that have had accidents. Similiar analysis on data that includes aircraft with no accident history may be of value.

Further analysis is needed to see how these reccomendations fit into other considerations the company may want to look at such as cost, ability to operate, etc.
